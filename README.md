# MemeQA: Holistic Evaluation for Meme Understanding

MemeQA is a dataset of over 9000 questions on meme understanding abilities. There are two versions of it -- None- (without "None of the above" option) and None+ (with "None of the above" option). 


## Data
The two dataset versions are stored in `none-minus/` and `none-plus/`. There, the JSON files show the questions, options, answer key, and other fields. The original meme images can be found in the repository of the [SemEval 2021 Task 6](https://github.com/di-dimitrov/SEMEVAL-2021-task6-corpus/tree/main/data).
